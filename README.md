# Ghook
G-Hook is a highly modular and non-invasive hooking framework designed to introduce experimental code execution without modifying the core system. Developed at Goethe University, G-Hook provides a structured way to manage function injections, allowing researchers and developers to extend and modify existing software dynamically.
